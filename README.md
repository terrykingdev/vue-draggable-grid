# vue-draggable-grid

Didn't have much luck finding one of the draggable libraries that handled responsive grids (I'm sure there are, just couldn't find one). So this is a very simple means of dragging responsive columns into a new order.

Vue2 + vuetify

To do:
* Show the item being visually dragged
* Add animation for the positioning
